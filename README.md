# webpack-skeleton

A webpack skeleton.

## Adding to Hotel

Navigate to the root of the project and run the following command in the terminal.
```
hotel add 'PORT=$PORT npm start'
```

Go into your browser and go to `localhost:2000`. You will see a list of your servers with the current project added to the list. You can start a Webpack development server with React hot reloading enabled from this page without needing to be careful of assigning an unused port to a new dev server.
